# Airbnb-booking-analysis-EDA-project
Welcome to my new EDA project on Airbnb Booking analysis. Here i had analysed the booking patterns of the customers, how pricing, location and reviews affect the business and what features make a listing more likely to get booked etc.
**BUSINESS PROBLEM OVERVIEW**

Airbnb is one of the leading platforms in the short-term rental market, connecting millions of travelers with hosts across the globe. As the platform continues to grow, understanding user behavior and the factors that influence bookings becomes essential for improving customer experience and maximizing revenue.

Despite having a vast amount of listings and user interactions, Airbnb faces key challenges such as:

1. *What features make a listing more likely to be booked?*

2. *How do pricing, location, and reviews impact guest decisions?*

3. *Why do some hosts consistently perform better than others?*

4. *Are there patterns in bookings based on time of year or geography?*

To address these concerns, a detailed analysis of Airbnb booking data is needed. This will help uncover trends, highlight areas for improvement, and support data-driven decisions for both Airbnb and its hosts.
